RECOMMENDATION WITH SUFFICIENT RESOURCES
----------------------------------------
Based on the analysis, OpenMP demonstrates the best performance
for the vector addition algorithm with 10 million elements.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. PRIMARY: Use OpenMP implementation
   - Provides 5.2x speedup over serial
   - Optimal configuration: 8

2. HYBRID STRATEGY (if resources allow):
   a. Use OpenMP for main computation
   b. Use MPI for pre/post-processing
   c. Use CUDA for data distribution across nodes

3. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - For larger datasets (>100M): Consider MPI for distributed memory
   - For real-time processing: CUDA provides lowest latency
   - For CPU-only systems: OpenMP offers best performance
